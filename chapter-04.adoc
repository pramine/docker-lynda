= Cluster of multiple nodes

. What is Swarm Mode?
.. What is it?
.. Master (primary and secondary) and Worker, Raft/Gossip
. Create Swarm Mode cluster using Docker Machine
.. Configure CLI to talk to primary
.. `docker ps`
.. `docker node ls`
.. Configure CLI to talk to secondary and show results are similar
. Create Swarm Mode cluster using Docker for AWS
.. Create SSH tunnel
.. `docker ps`
.. `docker node ls`
. Replicated service
.. `docker service --help`
.. Create a WildFly service using `docker service create`
.. Routing mesh, swarm-wide ingress port
.. Scale service
.. Kill a container and show desired/actual reconciliation
. Rolling Update
. Node maintenance
.. Node failure
... Only in Docker Machine, ASG in AWS
... Terminate a Docker Machine, wait for the container to be rescheduled, service reconciliation
.. Pause/Active - show that the container is not rescheduled
.. Drain - show that the container is rescheduled
. Global service
. Label/constraints
.. Attach labels to some nodes
.. Run a service with constraint
.. Show service scaling (only on the labeled node)
.. Run a new service w/o constraint (show it only starts on unlabeled nodes)
. Create a Couchbase cluster using service
. Docker Compose `bundle` command
.. Compare Dockerfile -> Image -> Container with Compose -> Bundle -> Stack
